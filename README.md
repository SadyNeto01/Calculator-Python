 The "Python Calculator" script is a simple command-line calculator program written in Python. It provides a menu-driven interface allowing users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, the calculator supports advanced operations like square root, sine, cosine, and tangent. The code utilizes Python's math module to handle mathematical functions accurately. Users are prompted to choose an operation, input the required numbers, and then receive the calculated result. The script includes error handling to prevent division by zero and ensures the correct conversion of degrees to radians for trigonometric functions.
